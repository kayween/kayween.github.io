Hi there, welcome to my blog.
I am a PhD student at the University of Pennsylvania.
You can find my academic website [here](https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~kaiwenwu/).

I recently started this blog to document interesting things I read.
I aim to keep each post concise and self-contained.
More technical material will be posted as notes on my website.
